# These are my thoughts on v3 of the argon transpiler

## Author Notes (my random thoughts on Argon as a whole)
I do not want to recreate the wheel. I feel that argon is recreating the wheel with typescript. I wanted to bring static typing to javascript. typescript can be used to statically type applications so that is not sufficient. I do not want to just create something for hobby. I want to create something that is legitemately revolutionary. I feel that I am going a little crazy with this project because I have no idea the direction its going. What is my future with software development? I don't want to build another crud application, I am tired of building stupid ass react apps. I want to create a statically typed language but do not have the consistent time to develop it. What can I build????
