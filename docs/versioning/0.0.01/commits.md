finished parsing more. I left off parsing parameter body in the actual function. Need to parse code block. need to do that recursively or iteratively. need to dictate the direction its going variable declaration, console statemet, return statement. using the arguments, using them correctly. not coercing incorrectly. validating static typing.

- for next week:
parse code block
- dictate direction codes going in.
- take into account variable declaration
- static typing
- not inappropriately using parameter types
- return statements validating return types
